                Today my back and neck are really hurting because
                I slept on the couch, which really stinks.
                It seems like there is too little time in the day.
                I want to learn to play piano and to draw and I want to write
                and read and now I'm trying to learn html. In the meantime, I 
                have work, I'm gonna start school next year hopefully,
                I have chores to do at home. Sometimes I just want to relax
                and watch youtube all day but then I get mad at myself
                for wasting a day. It's hard though. Everything is at least a little
                exhausting. I haven't sat down to listen to an album in a while.
                There's just too little time in the day.
