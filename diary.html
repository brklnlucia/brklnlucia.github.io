                Today my back and neck are really hurting because
                I slept on the couch, which really stinks.</p>
                 <p style="text-align:justify;">
                It seems like there is too little time in the day.
                I want to learn to play piano and to draw and I want to write
                and read and now I'm trying to learn html. In the meantime, I 
                have work, I'm gonna start school next year hopefully,
                I have chores to do at home. Sometimes I just want to relax
                and watch youtube all day but then I get mad at myself
                for wasting a day. It's hard though. Everything is at least a little
                exhausting. I haven't sat down to listen to an album in a while.
                There's just too little time in the day.

                I didn't end up coding with Katie, I forgot
                to bring my computer ;-; not sure we would've 
                had time anyway, we were too busy watching Eight
                Crazy Nights, the Adam Sandler. Katie thought it 
                was mid, but I have a lot of nostalgia for it so 
                I forgive it its flaws. 
            </p>
             <p style="text-align:justify;">
                I've been thinking a lot about why the internet is 
                boring now. Now that I have a website, I've been 
                having to make a choice between what excites me 
                and what is actually legible. I think once I've
                learned more code and have the site where I want it, 
                I'll be able to find a happy medium. The internet being
                boring isn't just chalked up to legibility, though.
                The whole world has become more bland, it seems.
                No more play places, just brown coffee shop aesthetics,
                no more bright, colourful cars, just 'sleek' whites, blacks, and greys.
                Maybe a red in there if you're daring. The world has become
                so much more beige, so much more streamlined.
                Katie once said that everyone wants to be the iphone.<br>
                I read a book a while back, I wish I could remember
                its name, but it said that people like the aesthetics that
                represent what they feel is missing in society. That 
                really stuck with me, but I think it's unfinished, lacking 
                in, dare I say, class analysis. I can see how what I call
                boring someone else might call calm, orderly, and they
                may feel that we live in a chaotic world and feel a desire
                to see calmness projected through aesthetics. But it's 
                impossible not to observe the shame these people also feel.
                When I hear
                from people advocating for 'sleekness,' which I would call
                beigeness or blandness, typically the argument is framed around an underlying shame. Shame of being 
                perceived as tacky, shame of not fitting in with chique trends,
                shame of not being behind the times. <br>I think the flag
                reform movement of the past ten years is a good example
                of this. Most people don't actually care about their damn city flag 
                beyond feeling shame that it's 'poorly designed,' whatever
                that means. They cite these arbitrary rules some guy made up
                as if they're gospel and not, you know, some guys 
                opinion. Don't be afraid to form your own opinion!
                Flags are art, you don't need rules for them GOSH!
                <br>I'm getting off track. The point is, I think that 
                this shame boils down to wanting to be attached to affluence.
                We're sold images of sleek, calm white rooms
                where the influential and brilliant gather to 
                shape the world. We're told that efficiency and productivity
                are the greatest virtues. We are sold these aesthetics
                by the spaces and the material conditions that we are 
                require to exist in.<br>I'm just ranting at this point.
                I don't really know where I'm going with this. Maybe 
                I'll try to write about this in more detail later and
                put it in writing. I just wish the world were more colourful.

                It has been a little while since I updated.
                Been thinking about other things. It's a new year!
                For the first time in a long time that's exciting to me.
                It feels like everything smells fresher.
                A lot happened to me last year. I fell in and out of
                love with someone, I moved to Milwaukee,
                I finally got on medication, I made community
                with wonderful people, and I got a job that I love.
                Despite the horror that we live with, joy arrives in
                small bursts and makes it all worth it.
                I hope my 2026 is as good as my 2025.
                I'm gonna try my best :)

                I think New Years resolutions are underrated these days.
                The fact that they never really stick
                has made people think that they're useless,
                and certain people love smugly touting that around.
                I hate when people do things smugly.
                <br>I think that the value in new years resolutions
                is in what they say about someone. I think talking
                about your resolutions is a really personal act,
                a simple way to pour out a piece of yourself.
                It's casual, yes, but so many profound things are.
                In that quick conversation with your friend or coworker,
                you've said something about the person you hope to be,
                about where you think you have failed, about what you value.
                It may be that you want to lead a healthier 
                lifestyle. You may want to see your family
                more. Maybe you want to just stop scrolling
                social media so much. Whatever it is,
                 it says something important.
                <br>It's these small things that make up a person.
                When you get to know someone, you are engaged in 
                the act of creation. You are crafting a person
                out of the clay of words and actions. 
                To  create something is to, for at least
                a brief time, love it. I think there is an
                incredible beauty in the act, and 
                I think that a tool which 
                so effectively communicates values and personal
                hopes shouldn't be tossed away just because 
                they aren't an effective way of setting goals.
                <br> Plus they're fun :p
                <br>If you're curious, my resolution is to use 
                my time more wisely.

                I've had a really nice couple of days. On Tuesday,
                we had a christmas party at work. I got some 
                great candy and an awesome book for secret santa,
                and luckily my secret santa liked her stuff too (PHEW).
                I went home with Katie and we spent all of Wednesday
                hanging out. I made her rice and beans for breakfast
                because it's really easy to make in a reasonably 
                stocked kitchen and it tastes good. then we went 
                to a car wash, then to a few stores to look around,
                then we went to ikea, an awesome art museum where you 
                can actually buy copies of the elements of each piece.
                Very neat concept.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I'm reading a book called "Facing the Abusing God."
                It's really good and interesting, beautiful and 
                satisfying in parts. Sadly, it's also written by a 
                Zionist and part of the theology is written to 
                justify Zionism. Not only that, but from a glance
                it seems like he is also an islamophobe and supports
                the war on Gaza.<br>This obviously makes 
                appreciating the book a lot harder. Every beautiful 
                verse about God is heavy-laden with the facts of
                colonialism and genocide. Every instance of the word 
                "love" marred by hatred. I'm not sure how to cope with 
                this. And if I can manage to still find it's beauty,
                could a Palestinian? Could they look past this flaw 
                and appreciate the insights it makes?<br>I think there 
                is one virtue though. The book draws on undeserving 
                injustices and contends with God as an abuser. I 
                think, therefore, I think a Palestinian may, as someone 
                who understands what it is to feel injustice, who 
                is subject to the butchery and bombing of innocents, who 
                live under apartheid in a concentration camp, who have
                had their homes stripped from them violently, gain
                much more insights from this book than I ever could.
                I think, in fact, someday a Palestinian may compose
                a similar work, perhaps of Islamic theology, crying
                out and asking why, why would God let this happen.
                I think one day, the genocide in Gaza will have a name 
                known and capiltalised by everyone.
                <br>I've chosen to style it God, rather than G-d,
                because that is the way it is styled in the book.
