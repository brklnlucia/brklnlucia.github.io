        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <h2>This is my slice of heaven</h2>
        <p>Feel free to stay a while and look around :3 
            I'm gonna use this website to host my writing and maybe other art, 
            and also to learn how to code. 
            You can't be mean to me yet because I am still learning how to use html. 
            Well actually you can be mean to me 
            but please don't be!
             Walk the straight and narrow.</p>
