            I just started coding last night. It's so cool.
            For a few years I've wanted to learn and assumed
            I wasn't smart enough to learn how. so far I'm very confused,
            but I believe in myself. I've learned some basic formatting things,
            like how to colour text and have a background image and stuff.
            I am a long way away from making my website pretty but I know
            it'll come with time. I also learned how to make the 
            a href link stuff by scoping my friend Katie's site with inspect element (but for some reason I can't get the text to align right idk why yet).
            I'm gonna upload pictures of my website when I learn how to,
            so I can see the stages it's gone through :) see you again soon!
           </p>

           <p>
            I have kind of learned how to put pictures on here,
            but I still don't know how to make them look smaller.
            Troubling indeed. My goal for today is to figure out how
            to put text into boxes and to figure out how to resize
            pictures. Also maybe to get a new background because I'm 
            not satisfied with the current one.
