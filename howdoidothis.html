            I just started coding last night. It's so cool.
            For a few years I've wanted to learn and assumed
            I wasn't smart enough to learn how. so far I'm very confused,
            but I believe in myself. I've learned some basic formatting things,
            like how to colour text and have a background image and stuff.
            I am a long way away from making my website pretty but I know
            it'll come with time. I also learned how to make the 
            a href link stuff by scoping my friend Katie's site with inspect element (but for some reason I can't get the text to align right idk why yet).
            I'm gonna upload pictures of my website when I learn how to,
            so I can see the stages it's gone through :) see you again soon!
